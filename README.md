# Project Description
<span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';">It is quite normal to miss out on daily medication, especially for the elderly, either due to memory loss or simply common forgetfulness. The rising frequency of ailments, such as chronic illnesses like Alzheimer's and Osteoarthritis, has fueled consumer demand for automated equipment.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';">The medicine dispenser covers that up for you. Using a timed circuit and four different pill holders to suit your medication, it will dispense the required pills at the right time. Afraid you might miss out on that too? Using state of the art IoT architecture and wi-fi technology, you can seamlessly connect your device to the dispenser, thus alerting you or your loved ones, no matter where they are.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';">An automated system such as the medicine dispenser ensures no room for under-consumption, overdosing or misuse by others. Looking forward to meeting your user.</span>
